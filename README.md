**Linux Systems Administrator | DevOps Engineer in Progress | Privacy-Focused Builder**

I run lean, think sharp, and build systems that don't need handholding. I automate, encrypt, monitor, and harden infrastructure with the mindset of a minimalist operator — not a corp drone. DevOps isn't a title to me, it's a philosophy: reproducibility, transparency, and resilience. Everything else is noise. I use Arch, btw. Jokes aside, I have a hard time to use anything else nowadays. I like to build my system clean and to know what's in it.

## 🔧 Current Focus

- **Certifications:** LPIC-1 → LPIC-2 → Red Hat Ansible Certified Specialist (in progress)
- **DevOps Stack:**
  `Proxmox` · `Terraform` · `Ansible` · `Docker` · `Vault` · `Bash` · `Python` · `Netdata` · `Uptime Kuma`
- **Cloud & On-Prem Integration:**
  Secure hybrid infrastructure with full disk encryption, automated provisioning, and strict GDPR compliance.
- **Linux Workstations & VMs:**
  Arch Linux (Plasma 6, Wayland) – minimal, encrypted, tuned. Window managers are ok, but take too much time to configure.

## 🔄 Projects & Labs

- 🖥️ **Proxmox HA Cluster + Ceph**:
  3-node + quorum breaker. Full replication with failover, local NVMe RAID for MySQL.

- 🌐 **Infrastructure as Code**:
  Terraform + Ansible for automated VM provisioning with cloud-init, Vault-backed secrets, LUKS encryption.

- 📦 **Monitoring & Uptime**:
  Netdata and Uptime Kuma across fleet.

- 🔐 **Security-First Networking**:
  WireGuard, Tailscale, ACLs, firewalls, strict SSH policies.

- 🧱 Build once, deploy anywhere, monitor everything.
- ❌ Avoid vendor lock-in and bloated dependencies.
- 🧍‍♂️ Obsessed with removing single points of failure and human error.
